# To-Do List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is a beginner's project that can be easily duplicated. It is a simple to-do list that keeps track of tasks.

Data is not stored, and if the page is refreshed the to-do list will reset. This will change in the future and will utilize local storage to ensure your list does not get removed upon refresh.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
